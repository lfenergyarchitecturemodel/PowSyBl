    documentation="Small signal analysis is about power system stability when subject to small disturbances (sub-cycle). If power system oscillations caused by small disturbances can be suppressed, such that the deviations of system state variables remain small for a long time, the power system is stable. On the contrary, if the magnitude of oscillations continues to increase or sustain indefinitely, the power system is unstable.">
