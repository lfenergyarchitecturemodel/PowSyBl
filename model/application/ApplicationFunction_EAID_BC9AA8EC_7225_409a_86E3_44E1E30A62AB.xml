    documentation="Transient stability analysis simulates the effect on the grid as a result of events that can cause oscillations in the speed and angles of machines and in power flows along the lines (e.g. faults, load changes, connection/disconnection of generators). Transient stability analysis is the study of the system in response to these changes and is used to determine if the system will be stable after a given disturbance. For proper operation of the system, it is essential to ensure that after a given disturbance, the system settles down to a new, stable condition."/>
